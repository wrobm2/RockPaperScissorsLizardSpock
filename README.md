# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock

To play these games, clone this repository and run `picker.py` with python3.

This repository contains four different implementations of the game Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock.

## Implementation 1

The first implementation is a basic version of the game, using a series of `if` statements to determine the outcome of each round.

## Implementation 2

The second implementation builds on the first, using arrays of possible win conditions to determine the outcome of each round. This implementation also keeps track of wins, losses, and ties, and has the ability to accept advanced input from the user.

## Implementation 3

The third implementation uses modulo to determine the outcome of each round. While this method is more concise, it may be less intuitive to some users.

## Implementation 4

The fourth implementation was created quickly by chatgpt, and showcases the ability of AI to create a working version of the game.

The file `ascii.py` is used by some implementations to print ASCII art.
